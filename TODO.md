# TODO
 - [ ] Search - only display title and owner of playlist (`<Paper />`); Route to `Queue` when clicked
 - [ ] Fix the `'Invalid Playlist ID'` message when searching for playlist
 - [ ] ***Do not add private or deleted videos*** to playlist
 - [ ] Use *this.state* for `playlist` using class (`React.Component`) instead of global vars?
 <!-- - [ ] shuffle button `onclick` -> go to `queue` page -> show queue (useState to rerender queue when shuffled) -->
 - [ ] Lazy load playlist (minimize heap size)
